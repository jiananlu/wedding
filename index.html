<a name="welcome-to-our-wedding" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-our-wedding"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to Our Wedding!</h3>

<p>Here you are! You can't help open the link in our invitation card, can you? ;-) </p>
<p>Welcome! We're so happy you are here and will join our wedding! Please allow us some words for the beginning.</p>

<p>Several months ago, we didn't plan to have a "wedding"; however, as things often happen, we end up with a wedding. A WEDDING!! That terrifies a lot of people (including Jianan). Preparing a wedding is an exhausted work (we can't count how many weekends we spent). But we also get something in the whole process: we laugh; we worry; we bite each other; we know people better and we also know ourselves better. Finally we decide to enjoy it because as we said in our invitation: where there is life, there is love. </p>

<p>So we hope you can also enjoy our wedding, our dear friends. It's a party to celebrate. Enjoy yourselves!</p>

<pre><code>Couple.new({
  :wife    => 'Fang',
  :husband => 'Jianan',
})
</code></pre>

<p>Anyone do a code review for me? ;-)</p>

<p>The church is not too hard to find.
