<p>Here you are! You can't help open the link in our invitation card, can you? :0) Welcome! We're so happy you are here and will join our wedding! Please allow us some words for the beginning.</p>

<p>We didn't plan to have a "wedding" several months ago; however, as things often happen, we end up a wedding. A WEDDING!! That terrifies a lot of people (including Jianan). Preparing a wedding is an exhausted work (we can't count how many weekends we spent). But we also get something in the whole process. We learn each other better; we learn how to deal with all kinds of people; we laugh; we worry; we bite each other. Fianlly we decide to enjoy it because as we said in our invitation: where there is life, there is love.</p>

<p>So we hope you can also enjoy our wedding, our dear friends. It's a party to celebrate. Enjoy yourselves!</p>

<pre><code>Couple.new({
  :wife    => 'Fang',
  :husband => 'Jianan',
})
</code></pre>

<p>Anyone do a code review for me? ;-)</p>

<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ceremony</h3>


<p>The ceremony will be hosted at <a href="http://www.valleypreschurch.org/">Valley Presbyterian Church</a>. We will start seating guests (you!) around 9:30 to 9:45.
  The ceremony will begin sharply at 10:00AM (We will start walking into the church nervously).
  So you're encouraged to arrive on time. A pretty lady will play harp to welcome you.</p>

<p>The whole process will last about 20 to 30 minutes (hopefully it's short enough to keep you awake). 
  After the ceremony is over, we'd like to have you stay a little while to take pictures with us.
  We'll print large pictures (with you in) and hang you in our home for years :-)</p>

<p>We'd like to give our vow in Chinese; however it will be relative hard for the pastor to understand and approve our marriage.
  As a result, we decide to use English first (for the pastor) and then speak Chinese as real.</p>

<p>The church is not too hard to find. It's in a woods; so don't be afraid when you find you're surrounded by redwood trees.
  This map might be helpful for you: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!data=!1m4!1m3!1d2803!2d-122.234334!3d37.38374!4m25!2m11!1m10!1s0x0%3A0xccaadc409643666c!3m8!1m3!1d100940!2d-122.4376!3d37.7577!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!5m12!1m11!1sValley+Presbyterian+Church!4m8!1m3!1d100940!2d-122.4376!3d37.7577!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!17b1">map</a>. When you see this sign, that is the church!</p>

<p>For you to park? According to our observation, there're plenty of parking spaces in the parking lot of the church. So don't worry about it.</p>
