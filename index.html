<a name="welcome-to-our-wedding" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-our-wedding"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to Our Wedding!</h3>

<p>Here you are! You can't help open the link in our invitation card, can you? ;-) </p>
<p>Welcome! We're so happy you are here and will join our wedding! Please allow us some words for the beginning.</p>

<p>Several months ago, we didn't plan to have a "wedding"; however, as things often happen, we end up with a wedding. A WEDDING!! That terrifies a lot of people (including Jianan). Preparing a wedding is an exhausted work (we can't count how many weekends we spent). But we also get something in the whole process: We laugh; we worry; we bite each other; we know people better and we also know ourselves better. Fianlly we decide to enjoy it because as we said in our invitation: where there is life, there is love. </p>

<p>So we hope you can also enjoy our wedding, our dear friends. It's a party to celebrate. Enjoy yourselves!</p>

<pre><code>Couple.new({
  :wife    => 'Fang',
  :husband => 'Jianan',
})
</code></pre>

<p>Anyone do a code review for me? ;-)</p>

<a name="ceremony" class="anchor" href="#ceremony"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ceremony</h3>


<p>The ceremony will be hosted at <a href="http://www.valleypreschurch.org/">Valley Presbyterian Church</a>. We will start seating guests (you!) around 9:30 to 9:45.
  The ceremony will begin sharply at 10:00AM (We will start walking into the church nervously).
  So you're encouraged to arrive on time. A pretty lady will play harp to welcome you.</p>

<p>The whole process will last about 20 to 30 minutes (hopefully it's short enough to keep you awake). 
  After the ceremony is over, we'd like to have you stay a little while to take pictures with us.
  We'll print large pictures (with you in) and hang you in our home for years :-)</p>

<p>We'd like to give our vow in Chinese; however it will be relative hard for the pastor to understand and approve our marriage.
  As a result, we decide to use English first (for the pastor) and then speak Chinese as real.</p>

<p>The church is not too hard to find. It's in a woods; so don't be afraid when you find you're surrounded by redwood trees.
  This map might be helpful for you: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!data=!1m4!1m3!1d2803!2d-122.234334!3d37.38374!4m25!2m11!1m10!1s0x0%3A0xccaadc409643666c!3m8!1m3!1d100940!2d-122.4376!3d37.7577!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!5m12!1m11!1sValley+Presbyterian+Church!4m8!1m3!1d100940!2d-122.4376!3d37.7577!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!17b1">map</a>. When you see this sign, that is the church!</p>

<p>For you to park? According to our observation, there're plenty of parking spaces in the parking lot of the church. So don't worry about it.</p>

<a name="reception" class="anchor" href="#reception"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reception</h3>

<p>Time for food! The restaurant is <a href="http://www.michaelsatshoreline.net/">Michaels At Shoreline</a> in Mountain View.</p>
<p>After the ceremony, driving yourselves there will take you about 30 minutes. We heard there will be a concert in the Shoreline Amphitheatre; so expect some bad traffic. For those who need ride, relaxe, we will have van or limo to take care of you.</p>
<p>When you arrive at the restaurant, you need to go through the main lobby to reach the ballroom; ask staff there if you can't find it. (I'm not sure if we're allowed to put any sign in public area yet; If we can, we will do so to make it easier for you to find the correct location.) Be free to pick any seats to sit you and your family. We don't want to make you uncomfortable by constraining you in a fixed seat; so you can sit among any ones you like. **Note to single boys: ask me for a list of single girls ahead of time so you can get prepared ;-). We reserved the ballroom from 11:00 AM to 3:00 PM. Buffet style food will be served during the hours. Stay as long as you like; enjoy yourselves.
</p>

<p>We prepared some small wedding favors as gift for you. Remember to take some with you. We also prepared some paper, pens and wish bottles for you to leave your name and wishes to us. We'll treasure this gift from you and keep them with us for years to come.

<p>Finally, please do us a favor to fill out <a href='https://docs.google.com/forms/d/195SLKiBKNoG_a_hYaN42R13C8YHIashPymHWDg5dW-o/viewform'>this form</a>. It will ask your confirmation to come and how many people you're going to bring. We pay for the restaurant by head count; so we'd like to know an estimate number in advance. Thank you!</p>
